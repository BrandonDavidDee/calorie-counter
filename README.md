# Calorie Counter

This is something I made for myself. Calorie tracking platforms typically feel obnoxiously over-engineered. Personally I don't want to create an
account, nor do I need to see long term analytics as I take calorie tracking day by day. Total calories and total protein are the only metrics I am personally interested in.

That being said, I tend to just write things down with pen and paper so this is just a simple digital version that I can keep open in a browser.

There is no backend, no api calls, no cookies or local storage. If you refresh you start over.

## Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```

### Build the app for production
